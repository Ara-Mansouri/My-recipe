    <h2><font size="+5">How to make</font></h2>
    <p><font size="+3">1.Prepare the fettuccine noodles! We’re looking for the perfect al dente noodle so make sure to cook it according to the package directions! When the sauce is added, it’ll be soaked up into the noodle while still providing that bite we all crave!</font></p>
    <p><font size="+3">2.Sear the chicken! Pat each chicken breast dry – this will help maintain that beautiful crust. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, then add olive oil to a medium-high heat skillet. Gently place the chicken in and let cook on each side until brown and crispy. Pro Tip: if the chicken breast seems to be stuck to the pan, don’t pull it up. It’ll be ready to flip when it easily releases. In the last few minutes, add the butter to lock in the flavor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+3">3.Make the creamy sauce! The most decadent part! Melt the butter, then add in both garlics (a real game changer!), nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook until fragrant, and your kitchen smells absolutely wonderful. Then, slowly add in the cream and bring to a light simmer. Add in the freshly grated parmesan cheese and whisk until thick.</font></p>
    <p><font size="+3"> 4.Assemble and serve! Lightly toss the noodles into the sauce, ensuring that each noodle is completely coated. Slice the chicken and place it on top. Ta-Da!</font></p>
